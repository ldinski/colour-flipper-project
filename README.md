# colour-flipper-project

random hex code colour picker adapted from johnsmilga's website. Basic use of array's to get a selection of colours on the 'simple' website. on the 'hex' website it uses an array of 1-9 and A-F and using a random number generator it uses the array length to pick 6 random values, therefore giving a random hex code and subsequently changing the background colour on the body of the page.
